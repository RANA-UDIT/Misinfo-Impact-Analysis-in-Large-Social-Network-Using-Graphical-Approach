# Misinfo-Impact-Analysis-in-Large-Social-Network-Using-Graphical-Approach
Modeling Misinformation Propagation and Impact Analysis through Large-Scale Community Detection


## Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive framework for analyzing misinformation propagation within large-scale social networks. The system is designed to tackle complex challenges related to managing large amounts of interconnected data, detecting community structures, modeling information spread, and assessing the impact of potentially harmful content. By leveraging advanced graph theory, machine learning (ML), and epidemiological models, the system provides a modular, scalable platform that can adapt to the ever-changing dynamics of social networks and misinformation trends.

### Key Features
- Efficient graph representation for large-scale social networks.
- Advanced community detection algorithms to identify network substructures.
- Sophisticated misinformation propagation models using finite state machines (FSMs).
- Dynamic message spread simulation using epidemiological principles.
- Comprehensive impact analysis and predictive modeling.

## System Modules

### **Module 1: Network Topology (Graph) Management**
This module handles the representation and management of large social network graphs using graph theory techniques.

#### 1.1 Adjacency List
- **Graph Representation**: We use an undirected graph G = (V, E), where vertices (V) represent users and edges (E) represent connections between users.
- **Efficient Data Structure**: The adjacency list is the primary data structure used for sparse graph representation.
  - **Space Complexity**: O(|V| + |E|).
  - **Time Complexity**: 
    - Adding an edge: O(1).
    - Removing an edge: O(deg(v)).
    - Checking connection: O(min(deg(u), deg(v))).

#### 1.2 Skip List
- **Skip Lists** are implemented for efficient node lookups and range queries in dynamic social networks.
  - **Time Complexity**: O(log n) for search, insert, and delete operations.
  - **Dynamic Nature**: As new users join or activity changes, skip lists adapt by creating "expressways" for faster traversal.
  - **Use Case**: Rapid retrieval of user properties, such as influence scores or community memberships.

#### 1.3 Ego-Centric Network Generation
- **Ego Network (G_ego)**: Individual-centered approach where each user (ego) and their immediate connections (alters) form local subgraphs.
- **Network Aggregation**: The global graph (G) is created by aggregating multiple ego networks.

#### 1.4 Data Acquisition
- **API Integration**: Use OAuth 2.0 for authentication and RESTful API calls to fetch data from social media platforms.
- **Web Scraping**: For platforms without APIs, ethical web scraping techniques (e.g., DOM parsing) are employed to gather relevant data.

### **Module 2: Community Detection in Large Graphs**
This module identifies substructures (communities) within the network, crucial for understanding the influence of misinformation spread.

#### 2.1 Louvain Algorithm for Community Detection
- **Modularity Optimization**: The Louvain algorithm is used to maximize modularity by grouping densely connected nodes into communities.
- **Phases**:
  1. **Initialization**: Assign each node to its own community.
  2. **Local Moving of Nodes**: Optimize modularity by moving nodes to neighboring communities.
  3. **Community Aggregation**: Treat identified communities as single nodes and repeat the process.
  4. **Iterative Optimization**: The process continues until no further improvement in modularity is possible.

### **Module 3: Misinformation Propagation and Detection**

#### 3.1 Message Propagation Model
- **Modified Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Simulates message spread with probabilistic user engagement based on network position and user behavior.
- **Propagation Probability (p)**: 
  - \( p = \text{base\_probability} \times \text{influence\_factor}(u) \times \text{susceptibility\_factor}(v) \).

#### 3.2 Finite State Machine (FSM) for Message States
- **States**: Created, Shared, Viral, Flagged.
- **Transitions**: Messages transition between states based on share counts and time.
  - Example: A message moves to the "viral" state after exceeding a share threshold.

#### 3.3 Misinformation Detection
- **Rapid Spread Detection**: The system flags rapidly spreading messages based on dynamic thresholds (e.g., shares per hour).
- **Content-Based Analysis**: Techniques like TF-IDF, Named Entity Recognition (NER), and sentiment analysis detect potential misinformation based on content features.
- **Scoring**: A weighted scoring mechanism is used to combine content, network, and temporal analysis.

---

### **Module 4: Impact Analysis**

This module evaluates the potential impact of a message in the network, especially misinformation.

#### 4.1 Impact Metrics
- **Reach**: \( R = \frac{|\text{Affected\_Nodes}|}{|\text{Total\_Nodes}|} \).
- **Potential Reach (PR)**: Combines direct, secondary, and tertiary connections with scaling factors.

#### 4.2 Propagation Modeling with Graph Attention Networks (GATs)
- **GATs**: Incorporate attention mechanisms to model how messages spread across the network, adapting based on node importance.
  
#### 4.3 Predictive Modeling with Random Forest
- **Random Forest**: Predicts message impact using a combination of message features, user influence, and network structure. The model is continuously refined with new data for increased accuracy.
